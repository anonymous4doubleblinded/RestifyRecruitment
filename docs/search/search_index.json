One manual task, using the IDE IntelliJ . One assisted task, using the software TouchCORE . Participants have to watch provided educational material of a total of 45 minutes, which is considered part of the experiment activity. Participants have to document their activity by means of a screen recording. Sound or camera recordings are not involved. Task Duration and Compensation Duration Internal test runs suggest that the experiment (including familiarization with video material and preliminary steps) can be accomplished in less than 2 hours. Based on your proficiency and time required for installation of required software task fulfilment may take longer than that. Participants are encouraged to finish both tasks, but they will still be compensated if they spent at least 90 Minutes of dedicated and documented work on each individual task. Once accepted, participants must finish their tasks and submit all results within July 11th 2022 - July 24th 2022 Compensation Upon task completion, participants will be rewarded with a 100 Dollar Amazon gift card. The gift card will be provided as code via email, given both of the following conditions are met: All requested files are uploaded. The uploaded files, especially the provided video documentation suggest a diligent study participation. The latter is defined as: Either task completion or documented activity of at least 90 minutes per task. Upon receipt of the gift card code, participants have to sign a form to confirm receipt. Selection Criteria ----- and ---- Lab staff or affiliates are excluded from participation. Anyone may apply, but there is no guarantee for selection. Applicants with the following skills are preferred: Sound programming skills in Java (required) Experience with Maven (useful but not required) Experience with TouchCORE (useful but not required) Experience with the IDE \" IntelliJ \" (useful but not required) Proficiency on the OS command line (useful but not required) How to apply Application closes July 9th 2022.
